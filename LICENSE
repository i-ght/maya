** hymn:
** In dense darkness O Mother, Thy formless beauty sparkles;
** Therefore the yogis meditate in a dark mountain cave.
** In the lap of boundless dark, on Mahanirvana's waves upborne
** Peace flows serene and inexhaustible.
**
** Taking the form of the VO id, in the robe of darkness wrapped,
** Who art Thou, Mother, seated alone in the shrine of samadhi?
** From the Lotus of Thy fear-scattering Feet flash Thy love's lightnings;
** Thy Spirit-Face shines forth with laughter terrible and loud!
