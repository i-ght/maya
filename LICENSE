** hymn:
O Kali! Thou hast brushed all difficulties aside.
Vedas and Tantras declare and SIva confirms - wilt Thou not admit this?
If Thou find a cremation ground, O Mother, Thou preferest it to a place set with jewells. 
O Mother! Thou and th Consort are all alike; He desists not fromc rushing hemp leaves.
He who is Thy devotee, Mother, has a different kind of lustre.
He is seldom clad in rags, cubs his body with ashes, and weawrs matted hair.
Thou brought'st me to earth and gavest me untold misery.
Yet I Mutter Kali's name - see how courageous I am!
People broadcast all around - Rama Prasada is Kali's son
Who will understand the secret of Mother's treatment with Her son?
